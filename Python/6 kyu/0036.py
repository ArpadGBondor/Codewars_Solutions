# Kata: Ho Ho Ho with Functions!
# Link: https://www.codewars.com/kata/52af1f150fcae8d33d0009bc

# Santa is learning programming. And what could be the first program, he wants
# to write? Yes, the "Hello world!" of Christmas: "Ho Ho Ho!". He wants to write
# a function ho(), which should have the following return values:

# ho()         # should return "Ho!"
# ho(ho())     # should return "Ho Ho!"
# ho(ho(ho())) # should return "Ho Ho Ho!"

# Unfortunately he couldn't find any tutorial, which explains, how he could
# implement that. Can you help him?

# Rules:
#   - each call of ho() must add a "Ho" to the string
#   - the "Ho"'s must be separated by a space
#   - at the end of the string, there must be an exclamation mark (!), without a
#     space


def ho(s=None):
    return f"Ho {s}" if s else "Ho!"
