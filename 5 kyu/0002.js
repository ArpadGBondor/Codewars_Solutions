// This time we want to write calculations using functions and get the results. Let's have a look at some examples:

// seven(times(five())); // must return 35
// four(plus(nine())); // must return 13
// eight(minus(three())); // must return 5
// six(dividedBy(two())); // must return 3
// Requirements:

// There must be a function for each number from 0 ("zero") to 9 ("nine")
// There must be a function for each of the following mathematical operations: plus, minus, times, dividedBy (divided_by in Ruby and Python)
// Each calculation consist of exactly one operation and two numbers
// The most outer function represents the left operand, the most inner function represents the right operand
// Division should be integer division. For example, this should return 2, not 2.666666...:
// eight(dividedBy(three()));

const num = (n) => (cb) => cb ? cb(n) : n;
const zero = num(0);
const one = num(1);
const two = num(2);
const three = num(3);
const four = num(4);
const five = num(5);
const six = num(6);
const seven = num(7);
const eight = num(8);
const nine = num(9);

const plus = (a) => (b) => b + a;
const minus = (a) => (b) => b - a;
const times = (a) => (b) => b * a;
const dividedBy = (a) => (b) => Math.floor(b / a);
